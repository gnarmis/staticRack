#staticRack

staticRack is a simple template for easily building static sites that can be deployed to Heroku. The config.ru file can be used to customize this setup and expose further subdomains.

The `sassycoffee` branch has been moved into a separate repository here: [SassyCoffee](https://github.com/gnarmis/SassyCoffee). It provides a simple way to use CoffeeScript and Sass to make static website, with auto-compiling, and is Heroku-friendly.
