#staticRack

staticRack is a simple template for easily building static sites that can be deployed to Heroku. The config.ru file can be used to customize this setup and expose further subdomains.

The `sassycoffee` branch has the files setup for development with Sass and CoffeeScript. It also provides a simple way to auto-compile both CoffeeScript files and Sass files.

The `sinatra` branch has a Sinatra-backed implementation.
